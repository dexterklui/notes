# Equity

Equity refers to the ownership value in an asset or company after all
liabilities have been deducted. It represents the shareholder's interest in the
company and can be viewed in different contexts, such as personal finance,
corporate finance, and real estate. Here’s a detailed breakdown: Key Contexts of
Equity

## Shareholder Equity

In the context of a corporation, equity refers to the residual interest of
shareholders in the assets of the company after all liabilities have been
settled. It can include:

- Common Stock: Represents ownership in a company and comes with voting rights.
- Preferred Stock: Represents a higher claim on assets and earnings than common
  stock, often with fixed dividends.
- Retained Earnings: Accumulated profits that have not been distributed as
  dividends but reinvested in the company. Calculation: Equity = Total Assets -
  Total Liabilities

## Home Equity

In real estate, equity refers to the difference between the market value of a
property and the outstanding mortgage balance. It represents the homeowner's
stake in the property. Calculation: Home Equity = Market Value of Property -
Mortgage Balance

## Private Equity

Refers to ownership in private companies or investments made in private
companies that are not publicly traded. Private equity firms typically invest in
or acquire companies to improve their operations and eventually sell them for a
profit.

## Equity Financing

This is the method of raising capital by selling shares of stock in exchange for
funds. It allows companies to gain capital without incurring debt but dilutes
ownership among existing shareholders.
