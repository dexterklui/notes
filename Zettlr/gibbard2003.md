# Gibbard 2003 Thinking How to Live

## Introduction: A Possibility Proof

### Problem of Descriptivists

-   Some descriptivists think that asking what ought to do is an identical question to asking what to do.
-   But Gibbard thinks that they lack explanation as to why the natural/non-natural property ought should have any bear on what to do.
-   It requires unnecessary step from going from what ought to do - to actually deciding to act.
-   Further, descriptivists, by separating what ought to do to descriptivist statements, and what to do to imperatives, **deny us rational tools and logics** when reasoning about what to do.
    -   Imperatives cannot be embedded to if-clause, for example. So no simple logical deduction can be used when deciding what to do. I.e. we have no language nor tool to reason our way to our decision.
-   Descriptivists have to separates two kind of rationality:
    1.  Rationality to form believes about ought-to-doness.
    2.  Rationality to act according to believes about ought-to-doness.

### Minimal Facts

-   Gibbard doesn't touch on the question whether it is a fact that "X is the thing to do" or "X is admirable"
-   Gibbard accepts minimalists view on truth but also is open to whether there are further significance distinction between "truth" and non-truth.
-   Gibbard is mostly aligned with Blackburn's characterisation of expressivism as quasi-realism.
-   In respond to the challenge that quasi-realism is realism in disguise, Gibbard argues that many realists are object to the central slogan of his expressivism:

    "Questions of what we ought to do are questions of what to do. Finish your deliberation, conclude what to do, and you've concluded what you ought to do." _p.19_

-   In this book, the main concern is the **possibility** of explaining the meaning of ethical concepts in expressivist way. This possibility is denied by many philosophers.

### What's at Issue

Gibbard developed a test more stringent and formal than Moore's Open Question Test. To test whether two words, x and y, have the same meaning:

1.  Try to construct two statements, A and B, that are identical except one uses x and the other y in the same place.
2.  If you can construct another statement, C, such that it is conceptually coherent to hold both C and one of the two statements and conceptually incoherent to hold both C and another one of the two statements, then x and y are conceptually different, i.e. they have different meaning, and x cannot be defined by y nor vice versa.

This tests rely on the notion of conceptual coherence and disagreements. Gibbard think there is no reason to be sceptical on these notions, for without them we can't even start to communicate and have a trackable conversation.

-   It's like what I heard: it is not **justified** to believe in these notions, it is **indubitable** (as in impossible and senseless to be argued against) to believe in these notions.

### Property and Concepts

-   Moore thinks it is possible to find a definition in the form like "intelligence and intelligence alone is good". But this fact has to be a necessary fact for it to be the definition of **the good**.
    -   The property has to be **necessarily conextentional** with goodness.
-   Meaning is different from properties:
    -   meaning is concept, concept is not property.
-   So Moore's test shows distinctness of concepts, not properties.
    -   So Moore conclusion doesn't show that good cannot be necessarily conextentional with some other (combination of) properties.
-   A term, e.g. 'pleasant':
    -   [[designates]] its [[extension]], the set of pleasant things
    -   [[signifies]] the [[property]] of being pleasant
    -   [[expresses]] the [[concept]] of being pleasant
