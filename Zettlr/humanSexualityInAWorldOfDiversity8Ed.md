# What Is Human Sexuality?

## Two Example Cultures

Stark contrast between two cultures from two faraway islands:
- Inis Beag: Culture that sees sex as taboo.
- Mangaia: Most sexually active culture.

## Sex vs Gender

In academia,
- **sex** is for anatomic or biological categories,
- **gender** is for social or cultural categories.

## Sexuality

**Human sexuality** refers to the ways in which we experience and express ourselves as sexual beings, e.g.
- awareness of ourselves as females or males,
- capacity we have for erotic experiences and responses,
- influences from our knowledge of the gender roles in our culture.
