# HTML

## Include Scripts

script in parallel to parsing the page, and execute the script **after** the
page has finished parsing.

## Form

### Submit Events

The `submit` event happens when:

- The user click a submit button for the form
- The user presses `<Enter>` while editing a field in the form
- A script calls the `form.requestSubmit()` method

However, in `XHTML1.1` mode the browser will complain about it.
