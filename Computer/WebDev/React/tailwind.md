# Tailwind

## Idiosyncrasy

### Dynamic Class Name Does Not Work

Tailwind doesn't include any sort of client-side runtime, so class names need to
be statically extractable at build-time, and can't depend on any sort of
arbitrary dynamic values that change on the client.

E.g. ``className={`bg-${color}-500`}`` won't work.
