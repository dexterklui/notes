# Some Keybindings

## Basic modes and movement

-   `v`: Select tool
-   `h`: Hand tool (scroll)
-   `f`: Frame drawing tool

-   `<C-Scroll>` zooms in/out
-   `Middle drag` moves page by dragging
-   `<A-drag>` duplicate an element
-   `<C-g>` groups items
-   `[` and `]` bring a selected element to front and back respectively

# Design flow

Try to break a webpage into different components, and design each one by one.

# Components

-   `<C-A-k>` or press the button on top to create a component
-   Some designers will make a separate frame that contains all the components
    for overview and use
-   You can make a new copy of a components using `<alt+drag>` easily.

    -   You can make changes to individual instances.

    -   Style changes in the main component will be reflected to individual
        instances, unless that individual instance has that kind of attribute
        changed beforehand.

You can also create **variants** of a components.
