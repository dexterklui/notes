# Databases

## Data Modeling

Efficiency

- Space
- Speed
- If small enough, and load to memory, then there is no I/O cost

Database languages

- **_Data definition language_** (_DDL_): Define the data model
- **_Data manipulation language_** (_DML_): Search for records, adding new
  entity

## E-R Model

### Entity and Entity Set

**_Entity_**

- An object that exists and is distinguishable from other objects
- E.g. A customer, an account, a department, etc.
- Have **attributes**, e.g. people have name and address

**_Entity set_**

- A set of entities of the same type that share the same properties (attributes)

### Relationship

- A **_relationship_** is an association among entities.
- A **_relationship set_** is a set of relationships of the same type.

#### Constraints

**_Mapping cardinalities_** concerns the number of entities to which another
entity can be associated via a relationship set. E.g. how many accounts can a
customer have?

**_Participation constraints_** concerns whether all entities in an entity set
have to participate in a relationship set. E.g. must every customer have an
account?

### Keys

#### Super key

A **_super key_** of an entity set is a **set** of one or more attributes whose
values uniquely determine each entity.

E.g. if `{customer_id}` is a super key, `{customer_id, name}` is another super
key.

#### Candidate key

A **_candidate key_** of an entity set is a **minimal** super key. I.e. no
proper subset of a candidate key is still a super key.

#### Primary key

Although several candidate keys may exist, one of the candidate keys is
**selected** to be the **_primary key_**.

In the E-R diagram, the primary key is **underlined**.

### Attribute Types

- Single vs **_composite attributes_** (consisting of **_component
  attributes_**)
- Single-valued vs **_multi-valued attributes_** (represented in **double
  ellipses** in E-R diagram)
- **_Derived attributes_** can be derived from other attributes.
  - Represented in **dashed ellipses** in E-R

### Weak Entity Set

A **_weak entity set_** is an entity set that does not have a primary key.

The existence of a weak entity set depends on the existence of a **_identifying
entity set_**. The weak entity set must relate to its identifying entity set via
a **total, many-to-one** **_identifying relationship set_** from the weak entity
set to the identifying set.

We depict a weak entity set by a **double rectangle**. We depict an identifying
relationship set by a **double diamond**.

The **_discriminator_** (or **_partial key_**) of a weak entity set is a set of
attributes that distinguishes the weak entities that depends on the same
identifying entity. So the "primary key" of a weak entity set is formed by the
primary key of the identifying set plus the discriminator.

### Role

Entity sets of a relationship **need not be distinct**.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  works{works for} --- |worker| employee[employee]
  works --> |manager| employee[employee]
```

The label "manager" and "worker" are called **_roles_**. They specify how
employee entities interact via the works-for relationship set.

### Specialization and Generalization

#### Specialization

Entities can be _specialized_ from a higher-level entity set to a lower-level
entity set which **inherits** all attributes and relationship set participation.
Lower-level entity set can have its own attributes.

Specialization can be:

- _total_ (double line) or _partial_ (single line)
- _Disjoint_ or _overlapping_ (default is overlapping)

Specialization is represented by an **inverted triangle** labeled as "ISA",
meaning _is-a_ relationship.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  MSc[MSc student] -.- ISA[\"ISA (disjoint)"/]
  ISA --- Full[Full-time student]
  ISA --- Part[Part-time student]
```

(Mermaid doesn't have triangle, so use trapezoid instead)

### E-R Diagram

#### Shapes

| Shape                             | Description      |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Rectangle                         | Entity set       |
| Ellipse                           | Attribute        |
| Diamond                           | Relationship set |
| Inverted triangle (labeled "ISA") | Specialization   |

##### Ellipses

| Variant | Description            |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| Double  | Multi-valued attribute |
| Dashed  | Derived attribute      |

##### Rectangles

| Variant | Description     |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Double  | Weak entity set |

##### Diamond

| Variant | Description                  |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| Double  | Identifying relationship set |

##### Triangle

| Variant            | Description              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Labeled "disjoint" | Disjoint specialisations |

#### Lines

| Line            | Description           |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| directional     | one                   |
| non-directional | many                  |
| double          | total participation   |
| single          | partial participation |

An account can be associated with at most one customer:

```text
[customer] <- <owner> [account]
```

An account can be associated with more than one customers:

```text
[customer] -- <owner> [account]
```

Each customer must have an account:

```text
[customer] == <owner> [account]
```

Not all customers are required to have an account:

```text
[customer] -- <owner> [account]
```

#### Example

A customer can have any amount of accounts, but each account must belongs to one
and only one customer.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  account_balance([account_balance]) --- account
  account_id([account_id]) --- account

  own{own} --> customer
  account[account] -.- own

  customer --- id([customer_id])
  customer --- name([name])
  customer --- address([address])
```

(mermaid doesn't support double line, so use dashed line instead)

You can read the diagram like a sentence:

- A customer _can_ (1st line is single line) own _many_ (2nd line is
  non-directional) accounts.
- An account _must_ (1st line is double line) be owned by _one_ (2nd line is
  directional) customer.

#### Building E-R diagrams

1. Identify the entity sets
2. Identify the relationship sets
3. Identify the attributes
4. Mapping cardinalities

### Design

#### Entity vs Attribute

Modelling employee and their phone numbers.

| Scenario                         | Attribute    | Entity                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Multiple numbers                 | Multi-valued | `üë§ <-- <has> --- üìû`    |
| Shared numbers                   | ‚ùå           | `üë§ --- <has> --- üìû`    |
| Keep missed call for each number | ‚ùå           | `üìû --- ((missed_call))` |

#### Entity Sets vs Relationship Sets

Entity set usually in **noun**, whereas relationship set usually in **verb**.

Modelling a loan:

`[loan]` or `[customer] --- <loan> --- [branch]`

| Scenario   | Entity Set                           | Relationship Set |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Joint loan | `[customer] --- <borrow> --- [loan]` | ‚ùå               |

### Relational Tables

#### Entity sets and attributes

- An _entity set_ (or strong entity set) _reduces_ to a **table** with the same
  attributes.
- _Composite attributes_ are _flattened_ into separate attributes in **dot
  notation**.
- A _multi-valued attribute_ _M_ of an entity set _E_ is represented by a
  **separate table _EM_** with the primary key as one of _EM_'s attribute.
  - It's like many-to-one relationship set, with total participation on the
    many-side.
- A _weak entity set_ becomes a table that includes the columns for the
  **primary key of the identifying entity set**.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph _player[" "]
    direction TB
    player[player]
    player --- player_number([player_number])
    player --- name([name])
    player --- address([address])
    player --- phone(["(( phone ))"])
    name --- first_name([first_name])
    name --- last_name([last_name])
  end

  subgraph _team[" "]
    direction TB
    team --- team_id([team_id])
  end

  _player -.- belongs{belongs} .-> _team
```

| team_id | player_number | name.first_name | name.last_name | address |
| ------- | ------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| ...     | ...           | ...             | ...            | ...     |

| player_number | phone     |
| ------------- | --------- |
| 1             | 1234 5678 |
| 1             | 2234 5678 |

#### Relationship sets

##### Many-to-many

A table with columns for the primary keys of the participating entity sets, and
any attributes of the relationship set.

```text
[team] --- <has> --- [sponsor]
```

| team_id | sponsor_id | sponsor_date |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1       | 1          | 2013-1-1     |
| 2       | 1          | 2013-9-1     |

`Team_asoc_sponsor` (**`team_id`**, **`sponsor_id`**, `sponsor_date`)

##### Many-to-one

If there's **total participation** on the _many-side_, add extra attributes to
the table on the many-side.

```text
[car] === <own> --> [person]
```

| car_number | ownership_date | person_id | ... |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------- | --- |
| HV2299     | 2013-10-1      | 1         | ... |

| person_id | ... |
| --------- | --- |
| 1         | ... |

##### One-to-one

Either side can be chosen to act as the _many-side_ as in many-to-one with total
participation on the many-side.

##### Procedure

1. Entity sets
   - Each entity set becomes a table
   - Attribute becomes a column, each entity becomes a tuple
2. Relationship set
   - Whether a relationship set becomes a table depends on the mapping
     cardinality.
3. Identify the key
   - What is the primary key? Any foreign key?

#### Specialization with Tables

Two methods:

- Table of lower-level entity set contains the **primary key** of the
  higher-level entity set and **local attributes**.
- Table of lower-level entity set contains **all local and inherited**
  attributes.

If the specialization is **total**, then we don't need to have a table for
higher-level entity set.

#### Foreign Key

A **_foreign key_** is a **referential constraint** between two tables. It is a
field in a relational table that matches a candidate key of another table.

It's used to cross-reference tables. It's an essential part of _database
normalization_.

- `Author` (`author_id`, `name`, `date_of_birth`)
- `Book` (`book_id`, `title`, `publisher`)
- `Writes` (**`author_id`**, **`book_id`**)

## Relational Algebra

### What is relational algebra?

- Like algebra, but relations (tables) as operands and a new set of operators.
- Inner, lower-level operations of a relational DBMS are (or are similar to)
  relational algebra operations.
- Need to know relational algebra to understand query execution and optimization
  in a relational DBMS.

### Basic Operators

- **_Selection_** ($\sigma$): Selects rows that satisfy a selection condition
- **_Projection_** ($\pi$): Selects columns
- **_Cartesian product_** ($\times$): Cross product of two tables
- **_Union_** ($\cup$): Union of two tables
- **_Set difference_** ($-$): Difference of two tables
- **_Rename_** ($\rho$): Rename a table or column

#### Selection

$\sigma_p(R) = \{t \vert (t \in R) \land p(t)\}$.

Select all authors called May:

1. ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Author WHERE name = "May";
   ```

2. Query process

3. $\sigma_{\text{name}=\text{"May"}}(\text{Author})$.

   Note that any attribute specified must be present in the table.

4. Resultant table

#### Projection

$\pi_L(R) = \{t[L] \vert t \in R\}$, where $L$ is a list of attributes.

Note that projection gives **distinct tuples**.

Report Book ID and title of all books:

```sql
SELECT bookId, title FROM Book;
```

$\pi_{\text{bookId, title}}(\text{Book})$

#### Union

$R \cup S = \{t \vert t \in R \lor t \in S\}$. Where $R$ and $S$ must have the
same **number of attributes**, and **attribute domains must be compatible**
(same type).

Name of all audio CDs and DVDs:

```sql
SELECT name FROM AudioCds
UNION
SELECT name FROM Dvds;
```

$\pi_{\text{name}}(\text{AudioCds}) \cup \pi_{\text{name}}(\text{Dvds})$.

#### Set Difference

$R - S = \{t \vert t \in R \land t \notin S\}$. Like [Union](#union), R and S
must have the **same number of attributes**, and **attribute domains must be
compatible**.

Find ID of students who haven't submitted their assignment:

```sql
SELECT studentId
FROM Students
EXCEPT
SELECT studentId
FROM Submitted;
```

$\pi_{\text{studentId}}(\text{Students}) - \pi_{\text{studentId}}(\text{Submitted})$.

#### Cartesian Product

$R \times S = \{t q \vert t \ \in R \land q \in S\}$.

- I don't understand what does it mean by "No attributes with a common name in R
  and S".

Display the date of tutorials of course "DB Intro":

```sql
SELECT Tutorial.date
FROM Course, Tutorial
WHERE
  Course.name='DB Intro' AND
  Course.courseId = Tutorial.courseId;
```

$$
\pi_\text{Tutorial.date}(\sigma_{\text{Course.name}=\text{"DB Intro"}}(\sigma_{\text{Course.courseId} = \text{Tutorial.courseId}}(\text{Course} \times \text{Tutorial})))
$$

#### Rename

$\rho_X(E)$, where $X$ is a new name for $E$.

The example in [Cartesian Product](#cartesian-product) can be rewritten as:

```sql
SELECT T.date
FROM Course C, Tutorial T
WHERE
  C.name='DB Intro' AND
  C.courseId = T.courseId;
```

$$
\pi_\text{T.date}(
  \sigma_{\text{C.name}=\text{"DB Intro"}}(
    \sigma_{\text{C.courseId} = \text{T.courseId}}(
      \rho_C(\text{Course}) \times \rho_T(\text{Tutorial})
    )
  )
)
$$

### Additional Operators

- **_Intersection_** ($\cap$): Intersection of two tables
- **_Natural join_** ($\bowtie$): Join on common attributes
- **_Left outer join_** (‚üï): Left outer join of two tables
- **_Right outer join_** (‚üñ): Right outer join of two tables
- **_Full outer join_** (‚üó): Full outer join of two tables
- **_Division_** ($\div$): Division of two tables
- **_Assignment_** ($\leftarrow$): Assign a table to a variable
- **_Theta join_** ($\bowtie_\theta$): Join on arbitrary condition
- **_semijoin_** ($\ltimes$): Semijoin of two tables
- **_antijoin_** ($\lhd$): Antijoin of two tables

#### Intersection

$R \cap S = \{t \vert t \in R \land t \in S\}$. Like [Union](#union), R and S
must have the **same number of attributes**, and **attribute domains must be
compatible**.

$R \cap S = R - (R - S)$.

#### Natural join

The schema of $R \bowtie S$ is the union of $R$-schema and $S$-schema (repeated
attributes are removed).

1. For each pair of tuples $t_R$ from $R$ and $t_S$ from $S$
2. If $t_R$ and $t_S$ agree on all attributes that are common to $R$ and $S$
3. Then add to the result a tuple $t$ formed by joining $t_R$ and $t_S$.

#### Assignment

Convenient to assign parts of a query to temporary relation variables.

Denoted by $\leftarrow$, which works like `=` in programming languages.

$\text{temp1} \leftarrow \pi_\text{title}(\text{Book})$

#### Outer join

Is an extension of natural join, to deal with missing information.

1. Nautral join results
2. Plus the tuples that **don't match any tuples** in the other relation

##### Left outer join

$$
\begin{align*}
R‚üï S &= (R \bowtie S) \cup (R - \pi_R(R \bowtie S)) \times \{\text{( null, \dots, null )}\} \\
&= (R \bowtie S) \cup R \lhd S \times \{(\text{null, \dots, null})\}
\end{align*}
$$

##### Right outer join

$$
\begin{align*}
R‚üñ S &= (R \bowtie S) \cup (S - \pi_S(R \bowtie S)) \times \{\text{( null, \dots, null )}\} \\
&= (R \bowtie S) \cup R \rhd S \times \{(\text{null, \dots, null})\}
\end{align*}
$$

##### Full outer join

$R‚üó S = (R‚üï S) \cup (R‚üñ S)$.

##### Semijoin

$R \ltimes S = \pi_R(R \bowtie S)$.

##### Antijoin

$R \lhd S = R - (R \ltimes S)$.

##### Theta join

$R \bowtie_\theta S = \sigma_\theta(R \times S)$.

#### Division

$R \div S$ is defined such that $(R \times S) \div S = R$. But in general
$(R
\div S) \times S \neq R$. See [this proof](#counter-example-of).

So
$R \div S =
\{ t \vert t \in \pi_{R-S}(R) \land (\forall s \in S, ((t \cup s) \in R)) \}$

$R \div S$ is used to express queries with the **all** quantifier. E.g. if
$R
\div S$ is a tuple of $(A = 2)$, then for tuples whose attribute $A$ is $2$ in
$R$, those tuples' values in the common attribute $B$ covers **all** values in
attribute $B$ of $S$.

##### Counter example of $(R \div S) \times S = R$

### Extended Operators

### Aggregation

Aggregate operation in relational algebra:

- **Grouping**: Divides tuples into groups
- **Aggregation**: Computes a single value for each group

$$
_{G_1, \dots, G_n} g _{F_1(A_1), \dots, F_m(A_m)} (R)
$$

- $R$ is a relation
- $G_1, \dots, G_n$ are attributes used to form groups
  - Tuples with the same value on all attributes $G_1, \dots, G_n$ are in the
    same group
  - $G$ can be empty, in which case there is a single group
- $F_i(A_i)$ is an aggregate function applied on an attribute

#### Aggregation example

$$
\rho_{\text{Result}(\text{branchId, sumOfBalance})}(
  _\text{branchId} g _{\text{sum}(\text{balance})} (\text{Account})
)
$$

- Since resulting relation has no name after aggregation, we use renaming
  operator to name the relation and attributes.

### Algebraic Properties

- Two relational-algebra expressions are **_equivalent_** if they always yield
  the same result on any legal database instance.

Equivalence Rules:

- In a series of _projections_, only the **last** one is needed:
  $\pi_{L1}(\dots(\pi_{Ln} (R) )\dots) = \pi_{L1}(R)$.
- _Conjunctive selection_ can be **destructured** into a sequence of selections:
  $\sigma_{p \land q}(R) = \sigma_p(\sigma_q(R))$.
- _Selection_ are **commutative**:
  $\sigma_p(\sigma_q(R)) = \sigma_q(\sigma_p(R))$.
- _Natural join_ are **associative**:
  $(R \bowtie S) \bowtie T = R \bowtie (S \bowtie T)$.
- _Selection_ **distributes** over _natural join_ under following conditions:
  - When all attributes in selection condition involve only attributes of only
    one of the two relations being joined:
    $\sigma_{p_1}(E_1 \bowtie E_2) = \sigma_{p_1}(E_1) \bowtie E_2$.
  - $\sigma_{p_1 \land p_2}(E_1 \bowtie E_2)
     = \sigma_{p_1}(E_1) \bowtie \sigma_{p_2}(E_2)$
    when $p_1$ and $p_2$ only involves attributes of $E_1$ and $E_2$,
    respectively.
- _projection_ can **distribute\*** over _natural join_:
  $\pi_{L_1 \cup L_2} (E_1 \bowtie E_2)
   = \pi_{L_1 \cup L2}(
     \pi_{L_1 \cup L_3}(E_1) \bowtie \pi_{L_2 \cup L_3}(E_2)
   )$,
  where
  - $L_1$ and $L_2$ are some attributes of $E_1$ and $E_2$, respectively,
  - $L_3$ are attributes that are common to both $E_1$ and $E_2$, i.e. are
    involved in the join condition
- Set _union_ and _intersection_ are **commutative** and **associative**:
  - $R \cup S = S \cup R$
  - $R \cap S = S \cap R$
  - $E_1 \cup (E_2 \cup E_3) = (E_1 \cup E_2) \cup E_3$
  - $E_1 \cap (E_2 \cap E_3) = (E_1 \cap E_2) \cap E_3$
- _Selection_ **distributes** over set _union_, _intersection_ and _difference_:
  - $\sigma_p(R \cup S) = \sigma_p(R) \cup \sigma_p(S)$
  - $\sigma_p(R \cap S) = \sigma_p(R) \cap \sigma_p(S)$
  - $\sigma_p(R - S) = \sigma_p(R) - \sigma_p(S)$

### Example RA Optimization

List the names of all instructor in CS department (id = 1) who taught a course
in semester 2, and also list the titles of those courses.

```sql
SELECT
  I.name, C.title
FROM
  Instructor I, Teaches T, Course C
WHERE
  I.dpt_id = 1,
  I.instructorId = T.instructorId,
  T.sem = 2,
  T.courseId = C.courseId;
```

$$
\begin{align*}
&\pi_{\text{I.name, C.title}}(
  \sigma_{I.\text{dptId} = 1 \land \text{T.sem} = 2} (
    \rho_I(\text{Instructor}) \bowtie
    \rho_T(\text{Teaches}) \bowtie
    \rho_C(\text{Course})
  )
) \\

= &\pi_{\text{I.name, C.title}}(
  \sigma_{\text{I.dptId} = 1}(\rho_I(\text{Instructor})) \bowtie
  \sigma_{\text{T.sem} = 2}(\rho_T(\text{Teaches})) \bowtie
  \rho_C(\text{Course})
) \\

= & \pi_\text{I.name, C.title}( \\

  &\pi_\text{I.name, I.instructorId}(
    \sigma_{\text{I.dptId} = 1}(\rho_I(\text{Instructor}))
  ) \bowtie \\
  &\sigma_{\text{T.sem} = 2}(\rho_T(\text{Teaches})) \bowtie \\
  &\pi_\text{C.courseId, C.title}(\rho_C(\text{Course})) \\
&)
\end{align*}
$$

## Functional Dependency

### What is functional dependency?

**_Functional dependency_** (FD) is a constraint between two sets of attributes.
It requires the values of a set $X$ **uniquely** determine (_imply_) the values
of another set $Y$, denoted as $X \to Y$.

I.e. $(X \to Y)$ $\iff$ $(t_1[X] = t_2[X] \implies t_1[Y] = t_2[Y])$.

### Armstrong's Axioms

1. **_Reflexivity_**: If $\beta \subseteq \alpha$, then $\alpha \to \beta$.
2. **_Augmentation_**: If $\alpha \to \beta$, then

## Closure

### Attribute Set Closure

Given a set $F$ of FDs and a set of attributes $\alpha$, the **_closure of
$\alpha$_**, denoted as $\alpha^+$, is the set of attributes that can be
functionally determined by $\alpha$.

E.g. $F = \{A \to B, B \to C\}$, then $\{A\}^+ = \{A, B, C\}$, also
$\{A, B\}^+ = \{A, B, C\}$.

#### Algorithm to Compute Attribute Set Closure

```text
result = a
while (changes to result) {
  for each X -> Y in F {
    if (X is a subset of result) {
      result = union(result, Y)
    }
  }
}
```

### The Use of Attribute Set Closure

- Testing for super key: $\alpha$ is a super key of $R$ iff $\alpha^+$ contains
  all attributes of R.
- Check if decomposition of a relation is **dependency preserving** or not.
- Useful for database normalization.

### FD Closure

The set of all functional dependencies that can be implied by $F$ is called the
**_closure of F_**, denoted as $F^+$.

#### Algorithm to Compute FD Closure

1. Treat every subset of $R$ as $\alpha$.
2. Compute $\alpha^+$ for every $\alpha$.
3. Use $\alpha$ as LHS, and generate an FD for each subset of $\alpha^+$ on RHS.

## Database Normalization

### What is database normalization?

- The process of organizing relations in a database to minimize redundancy and
  dependency.
- Done by **_decomposing_** relations $R$ to smaller, well-structured relations
  $R_i$.

### Normalization Goals

- **Lossless-join**: No information loss during decomposition.
- **Dependency preserving**: Avoid the need to join the decomposed relations to
  check the functional dependencies when new tuples are inserted into the
  database.
- **Reduce redundancy**: The decomposed relations $R_i$ should be in _Boyce-Codd
  Normal Form_ (_BCNF_).

### Lossless Join Decomposition

$R_1$ and $R_2$ is a **_lossless join decomposition_** of $R$ if and only if
either one of the following conditions hold:

$$
\text{schema}(R_1) \cap \text{schema}(R_2) \to \text{schema}(R_1) \\
\text{schema}(R_1) \cap \text{schema}(R_2) \to \text{schema}(R_2)
$$

That is, if the common attributes of $R_1$ and $R_2$ form a super key of either
one. If $R$ is decomposed into multiple $R_i$, then the decomposition is
lossless join if and only if the above condition holds for every pair of $R_i$.
That is, the common attributes of any two $R_i$ form a **super key** of either
one.

### Dependency Preserving Decomposition

During decomposition, we want to preserve the functional dependencies. That is,
we **don't need to join** the decomposed relations to check the functional
dependency.

A decomposition is **_dependency preserving_** if and only if
$(\cup_i F_i)^+ \to F^+$. This way, we can check the functional dependencies by
checking individual decomposed relations $R_i$ only without the need to join.

Consider $R(A, B, C, D)$ and $F = \{A \to B, B \to CD\}$.

1. $R_1 = \pi_{AB}(R)$ and $R_2 = \pi_{BCD}(R)$ is a dependency preserving
   decomposition of $R$.
   - $F_1 = A \to B$ and $F_2 = B \to CD$.
2. But $R_1 = \pi_{AB}(R)$ and $R_2 = \pi_{ACD}(R)$ is not.
   - $F_1 = A \to B$ and $F_2 = A \to CD$.

In the former case, we can check $A \to B$ and $B \to CD$ by checking $R_1$ and
$R_2$ individually. But in the later case, we cannot check $B \to CD$ without
joining $R_1$ and $R_2$.

### Redundancy

When all non-trivial functional dependencies (_non-reflexive_ dependencies) form
a key, the relation has no redundancy. We say $R$ is in
[Boyce-Codd Normal Form](#boyce-codd-normal-form) _iff_ for all non-reflexive
FDs $\alpha \to \beta$ where $\beta \nsubseteq \alpha$, $\{ \alpha \}^+ = R$.

#### Redundancy example

E.g. $R = \text{Customer}(\text{id}, \text{name}, \text{dptId})$ and
$F = \{ \{ \text{id} \} \to \{ \text{name}, \text{dptId} \} \}$ has no
redundancy.

On the contrary, consider

$$R = \text{Customer}(\text{id}, \text{name}, \text{dptId}, \text{building})$$

and

$$
F = \{ \{ \text{id} \} \to \{ \text{name}, \text{dptId}, \text{building} \},
       \{ \text{dptId} \} \to \{ \text{building} \} \}
$$

For each _id_ with the same _dptId_, the _building_ is the same, hence the
redundancy.

#### Verify redundancy

When $R$ is not decomposed, we can check only dependency given in $F$ (without
the trivial dependencies).

When $R$ is decomposed, we need to check all projections of ${F}^+$ onto each
decomposed relations.

### Normal Forms

#### Boyce-Codd Normal Form

A relation is in **_Boyce-Codd Normal Form_** (**_BCNF_**) when it has no
[_redundancy_](#redundancy).

##### BCNF decomposition algorithm

```text
result = {R};
done = false;
compute F+;
while (done == false) {
  if (there exists a Ri in result and Ri is not BCNF) {
    let a -> b be a non-trivial FD that holds on Ri s.t. {a}+ != Ri
    result = (result - Ri) union (ab) union (Ri - b)
  } else {
    done = true;
  }
}
```

Note that a BCNF decomposition is **not necessarily dependency preserving**. You
may need to generate an alternative decomposition that is dependency preserving.
It is also **not always possible** to find a dependency preserving BCNF.

Consider $R(A, B, C)$ and $F = \{ AB \to C, C \to B \}$. There are two candidate
keys: $\{AB\}$ and $\{AC\}$. So $C \to B$ cannot form a key ($C$ is not a key)
and hence $R$ is not in BCNF. Yet, if we decompose $R$, $AB \to C$ is not
preserved.

#### 3NF

- **_First normal form_** (**1NF**): A relation is in 1NF if and only if the
  domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the
  value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.
- **_Second normal form_** (**2NF**): A relation is in 2NF if and only if it is
  in 1NF and every non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the
  primary key.
- **_Third normal form_** (**3NF**): A relation is in 3NF if and only if it is
  in 2NF and every non-key attribute is non-transitively dependent on the
  primary key.
