# Threading

## Concurrent Programming

Concurrent programming (Multi-Threading) is sharing the same CPU resource (e.g.
same cores). Parallel programming is using different resources.

Register is the CPU memory. Context switch is the process of saving the current
state of the CPU and loading the state of another process. (Register stores the
states)

A thread has its own program counter, thread id, register and stack.

## Preventing a race condition

- Synchronization (monitor)
- Locks

### Synchronized Methods

When a thread calls a synchronized method, other threads are blocked from
calling **any** of the object's synchronized methods. We use the keyword
`synchronized`.

```java
private int counter;

public synchronized void increment () {
  counter++;
}

public synchronized void decrement () {
  counter--;
}
```

### Synchronized Blocks

More granular than using synchronized method.

When any thread is inside any "apple" synchronized block
`synchronized("apple") { /* code */ }`, no other thread can enter "apple"
synchronized block.

```java
public void increment() {
  synchronized(this) {
    counter++;
  }
}
```

### Reentrant Locks

```java
ReentrantLock reentrantLock = new ReentrantLock();
```

Some methods of re-entrant lock:

- `lock()`
- `tryLock()`
- `lockInterruptibly()`
- `unlock()`

Recommended to use try-finally block to ensure the lock is released.

```java
class X {
  private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
  public void m() {
    lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
    try {
        // ... method body
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
  }
}
```

### Reentrant ReadWrite Locks

## Problem with synchronization and locks

- Deadlock
- Livelock
- Starvation

## Thread Methods

### join()

Executing `myOtherThread.join()` on a thread means the thread will wait until
`myOtherThread` finishes before continuing execution.

### interupt()

- `myOtherThread.interupt()` will send causes `myOtherThread` to receive a
  `InterruptedException`. It's up to `myOtherThread` to decide how to handle the
  exception. Some may breaks its own loop and finishes the thread, some may do
  some clean up and terminates.

### sleep()

`Thread.sleep(milliSeconds)` is a static method that will cause the currently
executing thread to sleep for an minimum of `milliSeconds` before continuing
execution.

## Thread Communication

- wait()
- notify()
- notifyAll()

## Functional Interfaces

Interfaces marked by annotation `@FunctionalInterface` can be used as the
assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.

`Callable` and `Runnable` are examples of functional interfaces.

## Concurrent Collections

### Concurrent Map

Implementations:

- ConcurrentHashMap
- ConcurrentSkipListMap
- ConcurrentNavigableMap

#### ConcurrentHashMap

Retrieval operations (including get) generally do not block, so may overlap with
update operations (including put and remove).

An update operation for a given key bears a happens-before relation with any
(non-null) retrieval for that key reporting the updated value.

For aggregate operations such as putAll and clear, concurrent retrievals may
reflect insertion or removal of only some entries.

So I guess it means don't read a value, and use that value to do calculation and
then write the result back if there is another thread that can update the same
value in between.

### Synchronized Sorted Set

`Collections` has a static method `synchronizedSortedSet()` that wraps a sorted
set to return a synchronized (thread-safe) sorted set.

Still, it is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned
sorted set when traversing it or any of its subSet, headSet, or tailSet views
via Iterator, Spliterator or Stream:

## Threads Managements

Use `ExecutorService` interface to manage threads. Check the tutorial and docs
in [Links and Resources](#links-and-resources) below. Use this when you want to
follow one-thread-per-task model.

Join and fork are used for improving performance in cases where a task can be
broken down to smaller tasks recursively.

## Comparisons

### HashTable, HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap

`HashTable` was the first implementation of a hash table in Java. It is fully
synchronized in the sense any operation locks the entire table. Does not allow
null as key.

Later, `HashMap` was introduced to implement the `Map` interface, becoming a
member of _Java Collections Framework_. Unlike `HashTable`, `HashMap` is not
synchronized, and thus not thread-safe. Allows null as key.

`ConcurrenthashMap` also implements the `Map` interface and is thread-safe by
providing fine-grained synchronization to support high concurrency. It is more
efficient than `HashTable`.

### ArrayList, Vector and CopyOnWriteArrayList

`ArrayList` is not synchronized. `Vector` is synchronized.
`CopyOnWriteArrayList` is a thread-safe variant of `ArrayList`.

`Collections` has `synchronizedList()` method that wraps a list to return a
synchronized (thread-safe) list.
