## Introduction to SDLC

- [Guide to System Development Life Cycle - intellect soft](https://www.intellectsoft.net/blog/what-is-system-development-life-cycle)
- SDLC is short for System Development Life Cycle

The system development life cycle or SDLC is a project management model used to
outline, design, develop, test, and deploy an information system or software
product. In other words, it defines the necessary steps needed to take a project
from the idea or concept stage to the actual deployment and further maintenance.

## Stages

1. Planning - What are existing problems?
2. Analysis - What do we want?
3. Design - What will the finished project look like?
4. Development - Create the system
5. Testing - Is it the exact one we needed?
6. Integration and implementation - How will we use it?
7. Maintenance - Make improvements
