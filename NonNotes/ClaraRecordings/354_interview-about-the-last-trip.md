```
Q:	Excuse me. May I ask you a few questions about the last trip you took?
A:	Sure.
Q:	Thanks. First question. Where did you go on your trip?
A:	I wanted to go to a place where I could relax. So I went to big mountain. It's two hours from the city.
Q:	Where did you stay?
A:	We stayed in a hotel near the mountain. It was cheap, and it was nice.
Q:	What did you do there?
A:	We went for a walk in the forest. We walked past a river where we saw some beautiful birds.
Q:	Did you have fun?
A:	Yes. But we got tired when we had to start climbing the mountain. We went back to the hotel.
Q:	Thanks for answering my questions.
A:	You're welcome.
