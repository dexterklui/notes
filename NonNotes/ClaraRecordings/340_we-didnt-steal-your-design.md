```
Kay:	Marco?
Marco:	Hey there.
Kay:	I didn't know Marco was with you?
Anya:	It was a surprise.
Kay:	Please, come in.
Marco:	Is there a place where I can put this down?
Kay:	You can put it on the table.
Marco:	Thanks.
Kay:	So, what is so important that you are both here?
Marco:	Do you remember when I was in you cubicle the other day?
Kay:	Yes. It was the day when you had my new design.
Marco:	Yes. Your briefcase was in the place where you left it.
Kay:	Yeah, what about it?
Marco:	I told you I took your design because Tod would steal it.
Kay:	Yes. I don't want him to steal another one of my designs.
Marco:	Tod wasn't near your desk.
Kay:	What? I don't understand.
Marco:	I took your design because I think you have a lot of talent and we wanted to do something nice for you.
Kay:	Are you going to steal my design too?
Marco:	I would never steal your design.
Kay:	So why are you here?
Marco:	We're here because we're excited about your idea!
Anya:	And we're interested in helping you.
Kay:	You're interested in helping me with my idea?
Marco:	That's right. I'm not good at planning but Anya's good at it, so she made a plan.
Anya:	My plan was to get the coat to your briefcase, and get you out of the office.
Kay:	So you stole my design?
Marco:	No! I'd never stole anything. We borrowed it.
Anya:	Borrowed is different from stole.
Marco:	We needed it for a little bit. I promise you're going to be excited about this.
Kay:	You're not different from Tod. You took my work, and didn't tell me the truth.
Anya:	Hey, we're your friends. Aren't you interested in what we did with your design?
Kay:	What did you do?
Anya:	Remember, it needs work.
Kay:	What did you do?
Anya:	You don't like it?
Kay:	I love it! It's my design.
Marco:	It doesn't work right. We have more work to do but we wanted to show you.
Anya:	It was simple to put together from your design.
Kay:	This is so exciting. What did you use to make it?
Anya:	Some of it is plastic, but the other pieces are wood and metal.
Kay:	And a lot of oil.
Anya:	Oil makes it run smoothly.
Marco:	But it needed something else. We know you like nature, so we wanted to add something to it that reminds people of nature.
Anya:	So we went on a trip to find materials for it.
Kay:	You two are amazing!
Marco:	First, we went to the beach, but we didn't find anything there to use.
Anya:	But we did get a lot of sand in our shoes. Then we drove for two hours out of the city to the forest to go for a walk.
Marco:	We walked pass a frozen river. Then we climbed a mountain.
Anya:	Marco. It was a hill, not a mountain.
Marco:	Okay. We climbed the hill and there was a giant stone at the top, so we stopped there and watched the sunset.
Anya:	It was beautiful.
Kay:	Did you find any materials for this model on your trip?
Marco:	No. We didn't. But it was nice to get out of the city into nature. You're not mad at me because I stole your design?
Kay:	You borrowed it, and you did a great job. Thank you. Let's talk about it for a little bit before we have to leave for this party.
