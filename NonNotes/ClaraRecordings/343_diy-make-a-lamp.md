Welcome to the handy show. I'm [name]. Today, I'm going to teach you how to make
your own lamp. You can make a lamp from materials you already have at home, or
materials you can find in nature. It's amazing how easy it is. And the lamps you
make are usually more beautiful than lamps you can buy in the stores, too.

First, let's talk about a very easy way to make a lamp. With oil and glass. You
don't even need a light bulb. You're going to use a wig. A wig is a piece of
material that can sac up oil. You light the wig with the wooden match, and the
lamp burns. It works like a candle.

First, find an empty glass jar. Then get a piece of wire. Twist one end of the
wire to make a wig. Put your wig at the bottom of the jar. Then put the other
end of the wire outside the jar. Next, put oil into the jar. Don't cover the wig
with the oil. Finally, light the wig with a match. The oil in your lamp can burn
for hours. You can use your lamp even when there's no electricity. It's great!

Here's another easy way to make a lamp. This time, we're going to use light
bulbs and materials from nature.

First, go for a walk in the woods or at the beach. Find beautiful things, like
stones or pieces of wood. A big interesting piece of wood is better than a small
ugly piece. Then, take these things home, and make your lamp. Your piece of wood
can be the lamp stand. Hang your light bulb on your lamp stand. Then make a
shade to cover the light bulb. You can make nice light shades from thin pieces
of wood, or paper, or cloth. Try different things, and have fun with the lamps
you make.
