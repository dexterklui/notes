```
A:	My daughter is always complaining. She said our yard is boring, and she has nothing to play with.
B:	You should get a box with sand. What do you call that in English?
A:	Do you mean a sandbox? That sounds like a great idea. But are they expensive?
B:	You don't have to buy a sandbox. You can make one at home.
A:	Really? How?
B:	It's easy. You need some pieces of wood. You also need cloth and, of course, sand.
A:	Okay. So, how do I make the sandbox?
B:	First, find a good place in your yard. A big space that doesn't... Argh, how can I explain?
A:	A flat space that isn't on a hill? I think I understand.
B:	Okay. Then, you lay the pieces of wood down in that space. You make a box.
A:	Okay. And then do I put the sand in the box?
B:	No. You don't. First, you put the cloth down in the bottom of the box. You put sand in the box. And you have a sandbox.
