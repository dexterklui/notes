```
Kay:	My apartment is still a mess. It's going to take a long time to clean.
Anya:	Hello, it's Anya. Do you have plans right now?
Kay:	Plans?
Anya:	Yes. Are you getting ready to go out? Or are you going to stay in and relax?
Kay:	I'm not going to relax. I need to do housework, then make dinner, and do some work. Why? Do you want to go out?
Anya:	No, I need to come over.
Kay:	What?
Anya:	Can I come over to your apartment?
Kay:	No. You can't.
Anya:	Why not?
Kay:	My place is a mess. I need to straighten it up before I can have anyone over.
Anya:	Kay, it doesn't bother me.
Kay:	I have to do the dishes, clean the floors, do the laundry, and I have a sack of paperwork to go through before work tomorrow. Tod's going to be angry if it isn't done.
Anya:	This is important, Kay. I need to see you tonight. I can help you tidy your department. I can help do the dishes and wash clothes.
Kay:	It must be important if you're going to help me clean.
Anya:	It is. I can be there by 9 pm.
Kay:	That's in 2 hours. Can you get here before 9 pm? I have something at 9 pm.
Anya:	Yes, I can! I'm going to come after dinner, between 8 and 8:30 pm.
Kay:	Between 8 and 8:30 pm is good for me. I can save some dirty dishes for you.
Anya:	See you soon. Bye.
