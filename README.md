# DQN Notes

Most of the notes are in markdown, which can be accessed through the root
[index.md](./index.md). But older notes are in _dqn_ format, which reside in
directory [Dqn](./Dqn). Dqn format files are plain text files but are meant to
be read in Vim with my Vim plugin files:

- [syntax highlighting file for dqn](https://github.com/dexterklui/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/syntax/dqn.vim)
- [filetype plugin file for dqn](https://github.com/dexterklui/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/ftplugin/dqn.vim)
- [plugin file for dqn](https://github.com/dexterklui/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/plugin/DQNote.vim)
