# Understanding Emotional Intelligence?

## What is emotional intelligence (EQ)

It is the ability to

-   Understanding others' emotions and be empathic
-   Expressing emotions

It is a part of a personal psychology:

-   Personality
-   IQ
-   Emotional Intelligence

While personality and IQ are more or less fixed, emotional intelligence can be
developed.

## Measuring emotional quotient (EQ)

Four ways to measure EQ, corresponding to four areas:

-   Being aware of emotions
    -   Self-awareness
-   Expressing emotions
    -   Social awareness
-   Controlling emotions
    -   Self management
-   Relationship management
    -   Relationship development

## Managing emotional reactions

1.  Accept your emotions
2.  Slow down your reactions

Need to intercept in the stage of thoughts and responses. It takes conscious
practices to improve your ability to control.

# Being Self-Aware

## Emotions and behaviours

It is often a misconception that behaviours are simply reactions to an event,
but actually there is a missing step:

1.  Event
2.  Thoughts and emotions
3.  Behaviour

It is the emotions that affect your thought process and attitudes, and then lead
to certain behaviours. That's why **recognizing your emotions** is the first
step in building EQ.

## Personal reflection

It is useful to **reflect** past challenging experience. This can help you
understanding your own emotions and how they work.

## Cognitive hijack

A **_cognitive hijack_** happens when the way you think and process information
causes an **irrational** response:

1.  Trigger
2.  Emotions
3.  Irrational response

## Emotional triggers

Though **_cognitive shortcuts_** help you focus on important information and
make quick decisions, this automatic information processing can sometimes throw
your thoughts into wrong direction. This happens when there is an **_emotional
trigger_** causing a cognitive hijack.

It is useful to reflect past experience to find out any **recursively
appearing** emotional response, and their emotional triggers. Usually there is a
**theme** and knowing that prepares you to better recognise them in the future.

## Finding your flow

**_Flow_** is the complete immersion in an activity (or _in the zone_), when
work don't feel like work any more.

Benefits:

-   Achieve peak performance
-   Have a positive mental experience
-   Decrease emotional triggers

Working in a flow can make you more confident and positive, and can reframe how
you think about and face challenges, thus boosting EQ. Try to find it and add
more of that to the working life.

# Tools and Methods That Help Managing Yourself

## Reflection using ABCDE tool

Learning your _A-B-C-D-E_ during reflection of past events:

-   Activating event
    -   Try to describe it as objective as possible, like a reporter who doesn't
        have priori knowledge
-   Beliefs
    -   Leads to an emotional response
-   Consequences
-   Disrupting thought
    -   Replacing beliefs and thoughts with more objective one from a
        **bystander perspective**
-   Effect

## Slowing down reaction and choose appropriate response

1.  Identify the emotional reaction
2.  Remove yourself from the situation
3.  Give yourself time to recover
    -   Don't make decisions or thinking about the situation
4.  Challenge your thoughts
5.  _Choose_ how to respond
    -   You may choose the original emotional response or choose otherwise, but
        the important thing is you have control

## Shifting perspective to shape behaviour

1.  Seek out different points view
    -   Can find innovative way to deal with problems and situations
2.  Ask more questions
3.  Get acquainted with new people
    -   Get new insight from other perspective
4.  Read books on a variety of topics

# Social Awareness

## Developing social awareness

The ability to understand others and respond to their needs. Where you apply
what your learnt about controlling your own emotions outside of yourself.

1.  Use your senses to actively gather information
    -   Social cues: tones, facial expressions, body languages
2.  Seek to understand others' thoughts and relationship dynamics

## Connecting with empathy

**_Empathy_** is the ability to sense others' emotions, thoughts, and feelings.

To develope empathy:

1.  Ask questions.
2.  Imagine how the other person feels.
    -   Does't require similar experience, but only takes what your know about
        that person and the circumstance they are in
    -   But don't assume you know **exactly** what a situation is like to others

Also, don't try to identify with everything the person says, for it can be
irritating to them as you keep bringing the topic back to uurself.

Try to provide support by using phrases that doesn't sound definitive:

-   "I imagine that could make you feel..."
-   "I suppose that situation could you make you think..."

You want the other person to know you understand, but don't want them to think
you know exactly what the situation is.

## Communication and social awareness

Communication is not only about coveying your points to others. Rather
communication is a **bilateral interaction**. Usually what we communicate is not
nearly as important as **how** we communicate. When we communicate in a wrong
manner, we may not get our intended effect.

Your **unconscious communication** is driven by your thoughts, feelings, and
mood. That's why it's important to look inwards before considering how you
interact with others.

The key to effective communication is **listening**, which involves taking
notice of the words, tones and body languages. Although you might think getting
your point accross is important, especially in a stressful situation, being able
to listen can help you find solutions, uncover new perspectives, and reach
middle ground.

Take a second to reflect:

-   Do you listen intently?
-   What can you do to become a better listener?
    -   Maybe try put down what you are doing at the moment temporarily,
        especially when you are not a good multi-tasker. Besides, even if you
        are good at multi-tasking, this may strike others as you are not
        listening.

If you are not sure about the answer, ask people around you to get feedback.

# Managing Relationships

## Play to your personal strengths

Managing relationships takes practise.

To develop your skills in manging relationships, capitalise on your **unique**
communicative strength and style. This makes people feel they are making a
genuine connection with you, which helps to build trust.

Some communicative skills:

-   Communicating clearly
-   Listening closely
-   Ensuring people feel comfortable
-   Picking up on group dynamics
-   Making authentic connections

Some questions to help you find your own communicative strength:

-   How do others perceive you?
-   What skills do you have when interacting with others?
-   Do you have the ability to understand others' feelings?
-   What skills could you develop in these areas?

## Collect feedback to build connection

The only way to know how people perceive you is to _ask them_ for their insight.
It _is_ challenging and it makes you feel uncomfotable to do so, but it becomes
easier when you learn to listen to feedback **without getting self-critical or
defensive**. Good thing is, it doesn't require skills or preparation to ask
people's opinions.

The **Review, Refine, Repeat** process that can help you:

1.  Review how you manage relationships.

    Some questions to ask others:

    -   How do I general come across others?
    -   How do you describe me when I'm in a team environment?
    -   What am I good at when it come to interacting with other people?
    -   What could I tweak to get better at building and maintaining
        relationship?

    The feedback you get is not a fact, but an opinion. Don't be too hung up on
    one particular opinion, but try to get wide range of perspectives from many
    different people.

2.  Refine your approach to relationships.

    Focus one small step at a time. Often a one small step can compound to
    create a bigger result.

3.  Repeat the process.

    -   Taking the emotion out of it, and not perceiving feedback as emotional
        can turn this into a process (focusing on the process).

## Communicate intention and impact

How someone **perceives** the message can be more important than the message and
facts.

Focus on intention the others would take from you, and the key message you want
to bring, rather than what exactly is said. Because if people realise your
intention, even if the execution isn't perfect, they are still more likely to
listen and build trust with you.

Focusing on intent and key messages:

-   Boosts consfidence
    -   Relieve stress to get the precise wordings
-   Allows you to be flexible in your approach
    -   Change your style to adapt to the person you are communicating with
-   Allows for authenticity
    -   Bonus for connecting with people

Ask the question: "What do you want the other person to take away from this
interaction?" Match your tone, language and body language.
