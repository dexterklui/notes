# UX and Project Brief

## Starting with UX

Every project should start with a **_project brief_**, which specifies the
structure, content, target audience and general goal of the project. These _UX_
considerations should be considered before _UI_.

## Project briefs

A project brief is made according to the client's requirement. It contains all
the information you need to create the website, and will be the basis for the
**wireframe**.

## Content of project briefs

### General information:

- Basic info and background about the client and the project.
- Assets, e.g. logo
- Website goals, targets, and general principles.
- Website structure.
  - How many and what pages?
  - Brief summary of their content and goals.
- Header and footers (probably common to all pages)

### Some Q&A

Clarify the some do and don't and direction

### Structure and content

Include the content of each page as detailed as possible. E.g.

- Hero section: content in title, subtitle, description
- Product section: product images, title, description

### Design guidelines

Design preferences of the client. An example:

> Robert wants a modern looking website that would be easy to use by anyone. He
> likes to keep things clean and simple and loves designs with lots of white
> space.
>
> In terms of colour, he really likes the colour scheme of his logo so the
> website should probably mirror that in some shape or form.
>
> He will be developing the website himself and will be making it responsive so
> we need to make sure our design works well on other screen sizes.

# Wireframe

Low fidelity version of final design. It is a sketch the represents the final
product. It illustrates the content and structure but overlooks aesthetic
decision like colour, typography and spacing.
